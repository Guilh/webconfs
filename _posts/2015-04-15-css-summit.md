[CSS Summit](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2015/css-summit/) brings together some of the web's most notable experts for an all-new, three-day online conference. This year's event includes a live CSS and Sass conference, as well as an SVG, Sass, and advanced CSS track.

I'm also speaking about Sass on day two!
