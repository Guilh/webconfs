[Front-End Design Conference](http://frontenddesignconference.com/) is an awesome conference for web professionals who love their community, the web, and learning. It's a 2-day conference held every year in St. Petersburg, Fl.  This year's list of speakers is impressive. Some of them are Chris Coyier, James White, Sophie Shepherd, and more!

The day before the main conference, they're also running several full-day workshops on web animation, SMACSS, and frontend tooling.
